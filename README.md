# betterstdlib
This is a collection of things I think should be implemented in the C++ standard library, or things that are at least useful enough to be needed by me a fair amount of the time.

There are also some implementations for backwards compatibility with C++11 since I can sometimes be stuck wanting the newer features of C++14, 17, or 20, but I am stuck with a compiler
that can only compile C++11.
